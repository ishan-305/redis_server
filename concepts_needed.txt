Concepts Needed
==================
1. TCP/IP and Socket Design  -----
    1.1 created a header file RedisServer.h declaring the server class having port, server_socket, methods run , shutdown , and a constructor
    1.2 define the class in RedisServer.cpp
    1.3 make a shutdown and run (to make socket connection)
2. concurrency and MultiThreading
    2.1 Presitance Thread to dum data every 300 seconds
3. Mutex and Synchronization
4. Data Structure: Hash tables, Vectors
5. Parsing and RedisProtocol(RESP)
6. File I/o  Presitance
7. Signal Hnadling
8. Command Parsing and Response Formatting
9. Singleton Pattern
10. Bitwise Operators
